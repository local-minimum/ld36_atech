    "text": "Greetings!\n\nMy name is Dillarmaa (but people usually call me “The Iron Maiden”) and I run, as you probably already know, the well-known smithy in the village.\n\nEvery morning I get over two hundred forging orders for musical instruments, and every night when I sit and sip saké at the local tavern random people usually offer me valuable minerals or obscure metal records as thanks for the help.\n\nNow it is so that every single one of my favorite bands will come here to the village next week, completely independent of each other - it is pure chance, to play extremely heavy and rude music at the main square for a few days, non-stop. Therefore, I would like to show my support for the concert by blasting off hundreds of deafening fireworks right over the square!",

    "negativeFeedback": "That was not the sound and shape of metal at all, that was fucking dream-pop!\n\nMaybe you should check your senses at the closest hospital, amateur!",
    "neutralFeedback": "It was a rocking weekend and I rolled around through the crowds as a little ball and I even rolled up on the stage, but the band did not like it. Maybe they would have been in a better mode if there had been more explosions in the sky?",

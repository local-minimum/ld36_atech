I, Man of the Bulls, has decided to once again rely on your services.\n\nThe Empress of Eternal Apple Blossoms' lady-in-waiting: Justicia, known for her beauty and grace, will be staying for the springtime in the Emperor's summer palace, located close to here.\n\nOf course I want to take this opportunity to observe Justicia's slender ankles when she scurries around in the castle gardens at night and takes baths in fountains.\n\nFor that, of course, I need encircling lighting. And not only that, I also want a bombastic fanfare, and Emperor and Hero rays over me, when I surprise her posturing bare-chested in the largest fountain in the middle of the garden.",

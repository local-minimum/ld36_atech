I really have to win at all costs and to do that I have to drive really fast! My main opponent is Man of the Bulls - Baron of Fire, and he will also try to win as much as he possible can. I would like to order a fitting series of rockets to go off just when I drive over the finish line as number one.",

    "neutralFeedback": "I finished second, so I should not really complain. But if the pyrotechnics had been a little more potent, and gone of a little earlier, I might not had fallen asleep when I was about to cross the final line. The last I saw was Man of the Bulls overtaking me.",
